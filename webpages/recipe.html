      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 green apple</li>
        <li>handful of spinach</li>
        <li>1/4 cucumber</li>
        <li>lemon</li>
        <li>1 kiwi</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Let's cook</h4>
      <p>You'll need a smoothie maker to make this. Start by cutting the apple into pieces, removing the core and chucking in the blender.

      Peel and chop the kiwi and add to the blender.

      Then throw in the kiwi, the spinach and squeeze in some lemon juice.

      Blend it up! If it's looking a bit too gloopy, you can add a splash of water and blend again.</p>

    <div>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>50g oats</li>
      <li>fresh fruit (blueberries, banana)</li>
      <li>300ml coconut milk alternative (or regular milk if you prefer)</li>
      <li>coconut flakes (totally optional, only if you have them)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Let's cook</h4>
    <p>Grab a microwave-proof bowl (it will probably say on the bottom) and add the oats and milk.

Put it into the microwave on the highest setting for 3 minutes. Take it out, give it mix, and put it back in for another 1 minute blast.

Once it's done, add some fruit to the top, sprinkle with coconut flakes and dig in!</p>
